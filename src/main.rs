// I frequently develop difftastic on a newer rustc than the MSRV, so

#![allow(renamed_and_removed_lints)]
// This tends to trigger on larger tuples of simple types, and naming
// them would probably be worse for readability.
#![allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
// == "" is often clearer when dealing with strings.
#![allow(clippy::comparison_to_empty)]
// It's common to have pairs foo_lhs and foo_rhs, leading to double
// the number of arguments and triggering this lint.
#![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
// Has false positives on else if chains that sometimes have the same
// body for readability.
#![allow(clippy::if_same_then_else)]
// Good practice in general, but a necessary evil for Syntax. Its Hash
// implementation does not consider the mutable fields, so it is still
// correct.
#![allow(clippy::mutable_key_type)]
// manual_unwrap_or_default was added in Rust 1.79, so earlier versions of
// clippy complain about allowing it.
#![allow(unknown_lints)]
// It's sometimes more readable to explicitly create a vec than to use
// the Default trait.
#![allow(clippy::manual_unwrap_or_default)]
// I find the explicit arithmetic clearer sometimes.
#![allow(clippy::implicit_saturating_sub)]
// It's helpful being super explicit about byte length versus Unicode
// character point length sometimes.
#![allow(clippy::needless_as_bytes)]
// .to_owned() is more explicit on string references.
#![warn(clippy::str_to_string)]
// .to_string() on a String is clearer as .clone().
#![warn(clippy::string_to_string)]
// Debugging features shouldn't be in checked-in code.

/// The global allocator used by difftastic.
///
/// Diffing allocates a large amount of memory, and both Jemalloc and
/// MiMalloc perform better than the system allocator.
///
/// Some versions of MiMalloc (specifically libmimalloc-sys greater
/// than 0.1.24) handle very large, mostly unused allocations
/// badly. This makes large line-oriented diffs very slow, as
/// discussed in #297.
///
/// MiMalloc is generally faster than Jemalloc, but older versions of
/// MiMalloc don't compile on GCC 15+, so use Jemalloc for now. See
/// #805.
///
/// For reference, Jemalloc uses 10-20% more time (although up to 33%
/// more instructions) when testing on sample files.
